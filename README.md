# Pokémon Quiz Game Template

I have made this template for future reference for my community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HeyItsMedard/pokemon_quiz.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd pokemon_quiz
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App
1. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

### Required File
Make sure you have a `questions.json` file in the `public` directory. This file should contain the quiz questions in JSON format (see keys too).

### How to Play
1. Press the "Következő" button to move to the next question.
2. The app will display the correct answer and move to the next question if "Következő" button is pressed again until it runs out of questions.
